# Hand-Written-Recognition-using-IMU-sensor-
In this project we are developing a handwritten recognition system using Arduino BLE33 IMU sensors to capture motion data for numbers and alphabets, crucial for digitizing documents and gesture recognition.

# Harware used:
Arduino Nano 33 BLE

# Procedures to Follow

1. Collect the IMU sensor data for training, here we have trainned for "a-z" and "0-9", you either use the dataset in the datasets folder or create your own dataset and convert it into jsoin fileusing the website (https://tinyml.seas.upenn.edu/magic_wand_capture.html)

2. Validate the IMU sensor data, if individual datasets are taken verify each json files and combine the entire files into a single json file

3.
